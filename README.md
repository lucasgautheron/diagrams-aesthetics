# Tasks

In this experiment, participants rate scientific diagrams according to their aesthetic performance.

The experiment features three tasks:

1. A task for assessing participants' expertise about the target domain, in complement to their self-reported
   expert-status.
2. A comparison task in which participants choose the prettiest diagram among triplets
3. A direct rating task in which participants rate diagrams between 0 and 10.
